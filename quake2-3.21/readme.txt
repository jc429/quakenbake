~*~*~*~*~ Cooking Mama EX: Quake Edition ~*~*~*~*~*~
by John Cafiero

Hello, friend! Today, we are going to bake some Quakes... I mean Cakes!

Mama will show you how:

Step 0) Gather some friends, and start a deathmatch. Don't worry, nobody will die... yet.

Step 1) Obtain your mixing bowl! It may look like a grenade launcher, but that's just fancy packaging. Just grab, aim, and shoot your bowl out into a safe location on the field. It will fill itself with ingredients, don't worry.

Step 2) Grab a whisk. It may look like a shotgun, but trust Mama, it's a whisk. Carefully aim your whisk at the bowl and fire away! Don't whisk your bowl too much though, or the recipe will be a disaster!

Step 3) Gather that batter! Go find the (Super Secret) Batter Gatherer* and suck it right out of the bowl.
*HINT: It looks like a Super Shotgun!

Step 4) Time to put your cake in the oven. Press 'G' to pull out your handy Oven Grenades (patent pending)! Toss one out somewhere secluded and get cooking.

Step 5) Whoops! Mama forgot to mention that there's no outlets anywhere nearby. Looks like you'll have to generate your own power. Find a Chain Gun and some batteries and get to work! But careful, don't overcook it!

Step 6) All done! Did I mention your Batter Gatherer can also retrieve cakes? Pull them right out of the oven and get ready to share them with your friends! Take note, you're gonna need a Cake Launcher to share them!









/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This is the complete source code for Quake 2, version 3.21, buildable with
visual C++ 6.0.  The linux version should be buildable, but we haven't
tested it for the release.

The code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license).  
You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do 
anything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch 
is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the 
entire source code available for free to everyone.

The primary intent of this release is for entertainment and educational 
purposes, but the GPL does allow commercial exploitation if you obey the 
full license.  If you want to do something commercial and you just can't bear 
to have your source changes released, we could still negotiate a separate 
license agreement (for $$$), but I would encourage you to just live with the 
GPL.

All of the Q2 data files remain copyrighted and licensed under the 
original terms, so you cannot redistribute data from the original game, but if 
you do a true total conversion, you can create a standalone game based on 
this code.

Thanks to Robert Duffy for doing the grunt work of building this release.
